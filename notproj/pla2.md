### **🚀 Universal Web Scraper Plan (Fully Automated) - Bullet Points**  

---

## **📌 Overall Concept**  
- Users **input their query** through a chatbot.  
- AI **processes the query**, making it more precise.  
- AI generates a **Google search query** (e.g., `"neet registration notification site:gov.in"`).  
- Scraper **collects results** and extracts **relevant notifications**.  
- If PDFs are attached to notifications, **they are downloaded & processed**.  
- Processed **notifications are sent to users** via their preferred channels.

## **🔹 Technologies Used**  
### **1️⃣ Scraping Tools**
- **Scrapy** → For fast, static page scraping.  
- **Playwright** → For JavaScript-heavy, dynamic websites.  

### **2️⃣ AI Processing**
- **AI filters relevant information** from scraped data.  
- **AI determines if a site needs Playwright or Scrapy**.  
- **AI refines user queries** before sending to Google Search.  

### **3️⃣ PDF Handling**
- **PyMuPDF / pdfplumber / PDFMiner** → Extracts text from PDFs.  
- **Tika / GROBID** → For structured PDF parsing (optional).  

### **4️⃣ Data Storage & Management**
- **Redis / SQLite / PostgreSQL** → Caches and stores notifications.  

### **5️⃣ Notification Delivery**
- **Email / Telegram / Webhooks** → Sends results to users.  

---

## **🔹 Step-by-Step Workflow**
### **1️⃣ User Query Processing**
- User sends a **search request** via chatbot (e.g., `"latest NEET registration notification"`).  
- AI **parses and refines** the query.  
- AI **generates a Google Search URL** for the most relevant websites.  

### **2️⃣ Web Scraping Process**
- Scraper collects **Google Search results** (top-ranked pages).  
- AI **analyzes page structure** to decide:  
  - **Static site? → Use Scrapy**.  
  - **Dynamic site? → Use Playwright**.  
- Scraper **extracts only notification-related content**.  

### **3️⃣ PDF Extraction (If Attached)**
- If a notification contains a **PDF attachment**, it is:  
  - **Downloaded** using Scrapy/Playwright.  
  - **Parsed using PyMuPDF/pdfplumber**.  
  - **AI extracts key details** from the PDF.  

### **4️⃣ AI-Based Filtering**
- AI **analyzes extracted text** to determine:  
  - **Is this notification relevant?**  
  - **Does it match the user’s intent?**  

### **5️⃣ Storing & Sending Notifications**
- Notifications are **stored in a database (Redis/PostgreSQL)**.  
- Users **receive updates via Email/Telegram/Webhooks**.

## **🔹 Scrapy + Playwright Hybrid Approach**
- **Scrapy** handles:  
  - **Fast scraping of static pages** (HTML-based).  
  - **Simple sites without JavaScript loading**.  
- **Playwright** handles:  
  - **JavaScript-heavy sites** (e.g., dynamically generated content).  
  - **Websites requiring login or user interaction**.  
- **AI decides which tool to use automatically**.

## **🔹 Alternative Approaches**
🔹 **Approach 1: Fully Playwright-Based Scraping** (Not Recommended)  
✅ Works for all sites, but ❌ slow, ❌ resource-heavy, and ❌ detectable.  

🔹 **Approach 2: Use API-based Data Instead of Scraping** (Limited Feasibility)  
✅ Faster & legal, but ❌ many websites don’t offer APIs.  

🔹 **Approach 3: Headless Browser Scraping with Proxy Rotation**  
✅ Helps bypass bot detection, but ❌ still heavy on resources.  

---

## **🔹 Why This Approach Works**
✅ **Fully automated** – No need to modify code per website.  
✅ **Works with any site** – AI + Google Search finds the best sources.  
✅ **Scalable** – Scrapy keeps it fast, Playwright only used when needed.  
✅ **Intelligent** – AI **filters** unnecessary content & extracts **only notifications**.  
✅ **Handles PDFs** – No missing information if notifications are in PDF format.

## **🎯 Final Outcome**
🔹 Users can **ask for any notification**, and the system **finds & extracts it automatically**.  
🔹 The scraper **works universally for any website** without manual code changes.  
🔹 The project is **truly scalable & automated** with **AI-driven decision-making**.
