### **🚀 Universal Web Scraper Plan (Updated with Your Suggestions)**  

---

## **📌 Overall Concept**  
- Users **input their query** through a chatbot.  
- AI **processes the query**, making it more precise.  
- AI generates a **Google search query** (e.g., `"neet registration notification site:gov.in"`).  
- Scraper **collects results** and extracts **relevant notifications**.  
- If PDFs are attached to notifications, **they are downloaded & processed**.  
- Processed **notifications are sent to users** via their preferred channels.  

---

## **🔹 Technologies Used**  
### **1️⃣ Scraping Tools**
- **Scrapy** → **Default** for fast, static page scraping.  
- **Playwright** → **Used only if AI decides Scrapy is insufficient**.  

### **2️⃣ AI Processing**
- **AI is implemented as a function**, making it modular and reusable.  
- AI **filters relevant information** from scraped data.  
- AI determines if a site needs **Scrapy or Playwright** based on extracted content.  

### **3️⃣ Google Search Scraping**
- **We do NOT use Google’s API** (avoiding API restrictions).  
- Instead, we use **direct Google search** and extract organic results.  

### **4️⃣ Choosing Between Scrapy & Playwright**
- **Default:** Always start with **Scrapy**.  
- AI checks if the extracted content is **sufficient**.  
- If Scrapy’s results are incomplete → **Switch to Playwright**.  
- **Database stores the decision (Scrapy/Playwright) per website** for future use.  

### **5️⃣ PDF Handling**
- **PyMuPDF / pdfplumber / PDFMiner** → Extracts text from PDFs.  
- **Tika / GROBID** → For structured PDF parsing (optional).  

### **6️⃣ Data Storage & Management**
- **PostgreSQL / SQLite** → Stores notifications & past scraping decisions.  
- **Redis** → Caches frequently searched results for efficiency.  

### **7️⃣ Notification Delivery**
- **Email / Telegram / Webhooks** → Sends results to users.  

---

## **🔹 Step-by-Step Workflow**
### **1️⃣ User Query Processing**
- User sends a **search request** via chatbot (e.g., `"latest NEET registration notification"`).  
- AI **parses and refines** the query.  
- AI **generates a Google Search URL** for the most relevant websites.  

### **2️⃣ Web Scraping Process**
- Scraper **collects Google Search results** (top-ranked pages).  
- **Before scraping a website**:  
  - Check **DB for previous Scrapy/Playwright choice**.  
  - If found → Use the same tool as last time.  
  - If not → Default to **Scrapy first**.  
- Scrapy scrapes the page, then AI checks if the response is **sufficient**.  
- If AI finds missing or incomplete content → **Switch to Playwright**.  
- The tool choice (Scrapy/Playwright) is **stored in the database** for future use.  

### **3️⃣ PDF Extraction (If Attached)**
- If a notification contains a **PDF attachment**, it is:  
  - **Downloaded** using Scrapy/Playwright.  
  - **Parsed using PyMuPDF/pdfplumber**.  
  - **AI extracts key details** from the PDF.  

### **4️⃣ AI-Based Filtering**
- AI **analyzes extracted text** to determine:  
  - **Is this notification relevant?**  
  - **Does it match the user’s intent?**  

### **5️⃣ Storing & Sending Notifications**
- Notifications are **stored in a database (Redis/PostgreSQL)**.  
- Users **receive updates via Email/Telegram/Webhooks**.

## **🔹 Scrapy + Playwright Hybrid Approach (Optimized with DB Storage)**
- **Scrapy** handles:  
  - **Fast scraping of static pages** (HTML-based).  
  - **Simple sites without JavaScript loading**.  
- **Playwright** handles:  
  - **JavaScript-heavy sites** (e.g., dynamically generated content).  
  - **Websites requiring login or user interaction**.  
- **AI decides which tool to use automatically**.  
- **DB stores past choices**, reducing unnecessary processing in the future.  

---

## **🔹 Why This Approach is Better**
✅ **Fully automated** – No need to modify code per website.  
✅ **Works with any site** – AI + Google Search finds the best sources.  
✅ **Scalable & efficient** – Scrapy is fast, Playwright is used only when needed.  
✅ **Memory-efficient** – AI-driven decision-making minimizes resource usage.  
✅ **Faster over time** – DB stores past tool decisions for quick future scraping.  
✅ **Handles PDFs** – No missing information if notifications are in PDF format.

## **🎯 Final Outcome**
🔹 Users can **ask for any notification**, and the system **finds & extracts it automatically**.  
🔹 Scrapy is **preferred for speed**, but Playwright is **used only if necessary**.  
🔹 DB-based tool selection ensures **faster, smarter scraping over time**.  
🔹 The project is **truly scalable & automated** with **AI-driven decision-making**.
